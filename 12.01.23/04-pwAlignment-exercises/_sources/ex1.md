# Exercise 1

In this excercise a dynamic programming matrix should be filled to calculate the optimal pairwise alignment.

<h4>1. Apply the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to fill the matrix and compute the optimal score  </h4>

Fill the matrix and then check your result! Use the following scoring scheme:<br>
gapCost: -2
match: 1
mismatch: -1
